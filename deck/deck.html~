<p><strong>Most sites inaccessible.</strong> In 2004, the Disability Rights Commission found that <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3626533.stm">over 80% of web sites were unusable by disabled people</a>. The situation is no better today, as the Labour Party's own web site shows - among many other egregious errors in design, we find that much of the text on the page cannot read by screenreaders, and navigation of the forms on the right side is nearly impossible without proper labels.</p>
<p><strong>Huge economic and social costs.</strong> Laws like the ADA (US), DDA (UK), and the DDA (Aus.) specifically require web site owners to make their sites accessible, and some lawsuits have been successful - for example, the US retailer Target <a href="http://www.dralegal.org/cases/private_business/nfb_v_target.php">paid $6 million after a two-year legal fight</a>. The risk of losing a lawsuit is not the only cost to a business who ignores accessibility - the RNIB found that <a href="http://www.actionforblindpeople.org.uk/news/media-centre/faq-journalists,892,SA.html">there are over two million sight-impaired people in the UK alone</a>, a substantial potential market by any measure.</p>
<p><strong>Months or years to fix.</strong> When Target finally lost their lawsuit, they still needed six months of concentrated development effort to make their site accessible. Smaller firms with remote or outsourced IT provision find it even harder to fix their broken sites. Meanwhile, they remain in violation of the law and lose out on income from disabled people.</p>

<p>BlindPages makes a site accessible - without any modifications to the original site at all. How it works:</p>
<ol>
    <li>The user requests a page from blindpages.com.</li>
    <li>The blindpages.com server reads the inaccessible page from the original site.</li>
    <li>The blindpages.com server looks up conversion instructions specific to that page written in the BlindPages DSL by a trained programmer.</li>
    <li>Following the instructions, blindpages.com converts the page to an accessible version and delivers this to the user.</li>
</ol> 
<p><strong>Technology.</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://nokogiri.org/">Nokogiri</a> is an open-source HTML and XML parsing tool that deals well with both valid and invalid markup.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a> is an emerging programming language most famous as a component of the <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a> platform used by large, successful websites like Twitter.</li>
    <li>A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">Domain-Specific Language (DSL)</a> helps developers carry out a specific task with less code and fewer errors. The BlindPages DSL keeps per-page instructions brief and easy to maintain.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note display-only pages (without forms) can be navigated on the phone as well. Ring 0845 862 0346 to try this.</p>

<p><strong>Automated monitoring.</strong> <a href="http://www.nagios.org/">Nagios</a> is a standard tool for monitoring servers and web sites. BlindPages customises this tool to continuously and automatically test accessible sites to ensure they remain accessible, using easily-readable text as shown. Alerts can be sent by email or even phone and text message to ensure any loss of accessibility is corrected quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Human testing.</strong> There is no replacement for usage testing by real users. BlindPages can provide periodic checks by ordinary visually-impaired users, accessibility experts, or both.</p>

<p>The BlindPages vision is to provide, directly or indirectly, any of the six services described here, fitting them together to form campaigns as shown on the next slide.</p>
<ul>
    <li><em>Assessment</em>. Examining a web site, evaluating against standard criteria for accessibility, and creating a list of changes required to achieve full accessibility.</li>
    <li><em>External Conversion</em>. Converting a site to an accessible form without any changes to the original site. (See above.)</li>
    <li><em>Internal Conversion</em>. Converting the code and HTML that drives a web site to achieve accessibility.</li>
    <li><em>Project Management</em>. Co-ordinating the activities in the other five areas to form a coherent project that is completed to budget and on time.</li>
    <li><em>Training</em>. Educating developers, programmers, testers, business analysts, and managers about accessibility issues and creation of fully accessible web sites.</li>
    <li><em>Monitoring</em>. Using automated tools and manual tests to verify that a site remains accessible. (See above.)</li>

These pictures represent four ways of combining BlindPages services into a programme. Each has ongoing project management to ensure the programme proceeds smoothly.
<ul>
    <li>The <em>traditional model</em> involves assessment, followed by conversion and training involving the company's development team, and monitoring.</li>
    <li>The <em>bridge model</em> is like the traditional model, but involves a period where BlindPages supply an accessible site without changes to the underlying site.</li>
    <li>In the <em>campaign model</em>, we first convert a number of sites externally, without changes to them. This helps us prove that blind and partially-sighted people want to use the sites and that it is possible to make them accessible. Then, after a campaign to convince site owners to convert, we assist them in an internal conversion and training programme, followed by monitoring.</li>
    <li>The <em>portal model</em> is completely independent of site owners, with no changes required to underlying sites. We perform a number of external conversions and monitor for changes. The sites may be made available from a common portal.</li>
</ul>
