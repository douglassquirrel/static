      Hello and welcome to BlindPages - No-Hassle Web Accessibility!
    </p>
    <p>
      Our mission is simple - make your web pages accessible, with <em>zero effort</em> required from you! How do we do that? It's simple - our servers interpret your existing pages and re-serve them to customers in a fully compliant, totally accessible way. Your content is unchanged and your development and IT staff don't have to make any alterations to the main site at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      We operate our own servers and monitor them continuously to ensure your disabled customers are getting all your content and services. Our strict automated tests verify that your content is being rendered correctly. Included in the service are updates to match any changes you make to your main site.
    </p>
    <p>
      You might need our services if:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Customers are demanding accessible pages, but you don't have the time or budget for a site rewrite.</li>
      <li>You want to become compliant with laws like the Americans With Disabilities Act or the UK Disability Discrimination Act, but your IT staff have a huge backlog of work to get through first.</li>
      <li>A disabled person's organisation is pushing you to become accessible, but web updates are hard for your organisation to make (for instance, if your web development is outsourced).</li>
    </ul>
